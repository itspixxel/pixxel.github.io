                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Loot the Dungeon is a 2D dungeon crawler game coded in C++ using the S2D library. In the game, players assume the role of a Wizard on a mission to collect all the coins in a dungeon before the timer runs out. As they make their way through the dungeon, the Wizard must use their magical abilities to shoot and kill the enemies that stand in their way, including the Chorts and Demons that populate the dungeon, while also avoiding booby traps. With its fast-paced gameplay and challenging level design, Loot the Dungeon offers an exciting and rewarding gaming experience for players of all skill levels.

                    <p>
                        <h3>About the game</h3>
                        <img width="350" class="pull-right" alt="sample-image" src="images/gallery/fulls/LTD_GeometryWars.jpg">
                        <h5>Inspiration</h5>
                        The game is inspired by the classic retro twin stick shooter games of the past, such as Robotron: 2084 and Geometry Wars. Like these games, Loot the Dungeon features fast-paced, frenetic gameplay where players must use both analogue sticks on their controller to move and shoot simultaneously.
                        Another source of inspiration is the minigame "Journey of the Prairie King" from the popular farming simulation game Stardew Valley. In this minigame, players must guide a hero through a series of increasingly difficult dungeon rooms, collecting treasure and defeating enemies along the way. Loot the Dungeon takes this concept and expands upon it, adding new mechanics and challenges to create a more fleshed-out and engaging dungeon crawling experience.
                        <h5>Gameplay</h5>
                        <img width="350" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/gallery/fulls/LTD_Introduction.png">
                        In Loot the Dungeon, players use the WASD keys on their keyboard to move their Wizard through the dungeon. The left mouse button is used to shoot, and the mouse is used to aim at enemies. The objective of the game is to collect all the coins in the dungeon before the timer runs out, at which point the player wins.
                        However, if the player touches the spikes or is caught by an enemy, the game will end, and the player will be shown the leader board upon exiting the game. The leader board displays the top 3 scores of all players who have completed the game, providing a sense of competition and challenge for those looking to improve their skills.
                        When the game starts, all the components, such as enemies, traps, and the player, are loaded in and assigned their characteristics. The player then presses the space key to start the level. The timer starts counting down from 60 and any killed enemy or collected collectible is moved off the screen to avoid causing array decay. As the player collects coins and shoots enemies, their score increases. They can also collect the powerups such as potions to increase their speed or timers to add 5 seconds to the timer. Once all the coins are collected, the player is shown the game won screen and then the leader board when they press the escape key to exit the game.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a simple kitchen scene coded in C++ using OpenGL completely from Scratch. This was part of my Fundamentals of Games and Graphical Systems module for the first year of University where I learned the basics of 3D rendering and the OpenGL pipeline.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        <h3>About the scene</h3>
                        <img width="350" class="pull-right" alt="sample-image" src="images/gallery/fulls/OpenGLScene.png">
                        <h5>Scene Breakdown:</h5>
                        Objects and controls:
                        There are 4 focus points in the scene, namely, a toaster, a donut, a teapot, and a mannequin. The user can switch back and forth these focus points, which are stored in a map, by pressing the PAGE DOWN and PAGE UP keys respectively on their keyboard. Once at the last object, the user is simply switched back to the first object in the map if they try pressing the key to switch to the next object.
                        For the 3 smaller objects the user can revolve around the object by using the 'A' and 'D' keys. The user can also press the 'E' and 'Q' keys to move the camera up and down. I have disable the ability to revolve the camera around the object for the mannequin as the mannequin is spinning and it causes motion sickness if I revolve around it with the camera, the user can still move the camera up and down while focused on the mannequin.
                        Additionally, I also added a way to zoom the camera in and out by pressing the 'W' and 'S' keys on the keyboard. 
                        <h5>Specifications:</h5>
                        Each object in the scene has its own material, texture, and a tag that determines whether it is spinning or not.
                        Text is displayed above each object saying it's name. It also follows the camera so the text is always readable no matter how the user is looking at it.
                        The camera accurately revolves around the object instead of just flying in set directions in the world. I used the  cross product of the forward and up vector of the  camera for this.
                        Most of the objects are OBJs that are properly being loaded and parsed into the program.
                        I've also included a primitive cube that we created in the tutorials as a little easter egg in one of the focus points.
                        All the textures are BMP files that are properly being loaded and bound then being freed following the best practices for memory management.
                        I've kept the poly count as low as possible without losing too much quality by decimating the meshes used in Blender.
                        The scene uses backface culling, depth testing, and multisampling to draw the objects as visible.

                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                Crabs Ahoy! is a game that features a unique character controller that adds an advanced level of movement to the gameplay. The character constantly moves side-to-side, and the player's only control is the ability to make the character jump. The controller implements various platformer mechanics, including coyote time and wall jumping. These mechanics require precise timing and skill from the player, making the game both challenging and exciting.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>
                                <h3>About the game</h3>
                                <img width="400" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/gallery/fulls/CrabsAhoy.png">
                                <br>
                                The game features moving platforms that have a defined start and end point, with visual aid gizmos that draw in the editor. Additionally, an advanced inspector view allows players to adjust the speed and wait time for different moving platforms. These moving platforms add another layer of challenge to the game and require the player to time their jumps correctly to avoid falling off.<br>Crabs Ahoy! also features a health system that listens for every time the player takes damage. The player starts off with six hearts, and every time the player takes damage, the color of the last item in the array of hearts is set to black, and the health is decreased by one. If the player's health reaches zero, they are sent back to level one to start all over again.<br>The game includes various collectibles, including hearts and coins. The player can only collect hearts if they have taken damage. Coins are scattered throughout the levels for the player to collect, and they are added to a variable that keeps track of the coins the player has collected in the level and displays it on the HUD.
                                <h5>Features:</h5>
                                In addition to the above features, Crabs Ahoy! includes shooter traps, spike traps, and sound effects. Shooter traps are enemies that shoot little wooden spikes in a given direction, and cannons that shoot cannonballs in a given direction. These traps add an extra layer of challenge to the game and require players to be strategic in their movements. Spike traps are also implemented, and if the player touches a spike, they are instantly teleported to the start of the current level, and one heart of health is taken off. The game also features great audio feedback for the player, including background music, jump sound effects, and damage sound effects.
                                <br>
                                Lastly, the game includes custom UI that accurately scales according to the screen size. The UI includes features such as the hearts the player currently has, a coin counter, and a stopwatch board. There is also a static controls UI at the bottom left that explains how to play the game for any new players. The game is designed with object-oriented programming practices and efficiency in mind, ensuring that it runs smoothly and without any glitches. Overall, Crabs Ahoy! is an exciting and challenging game that includes a wide range of unique features and mechanics.

                                    <p>
                                        In the 2nd semester of the Games Engine Creation module, the task was to create a Mario Bros. clone using SDL and C++. This project imparted various skills such as Object-Oriented Programming, using the SDL library, creating a framework, and debugging. Compared to semester 1, it provided more coding practices that are useful in the industry. The game was based on the original 1983 version of Mario Bros., with modern textures and efficient code. The aim was to learn the logics that made the original game have tight player controls and good game feel.
                                    </p>

                                        <h3>About the game</h3>
                                        <img width="350" class="pull-left" alt="sample-image" src="images/gallery/fulls/MarioBros.png">

                                        2 players can play the game using the same keyboard. Player 1 (Mario) uses W, A, S, and D, while Player 2 (Luigi) uses arrow keys. To jump, use W/UP ARROW; to move, use A/D/LEFT/RIGHT ARROW. Double tapping W/UP ARROW results in a double jump. 
                                        The game starts with an intro screen and a button to start the game. The first level screen requires the player(s) to collect 2000 points. Points can be earned by hitting the pow block, stunning enemies, and collecting them (200 points each). Upon reaching 2000 points, the player advances to level 2, which is tougher and infinite.
